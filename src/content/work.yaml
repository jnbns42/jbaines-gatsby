      company: HSL Chairs
      text: > 
        The HSL Chairs website was recently rebuilt by my team at McCann, migrating from Wordpress to Umbraco. 
        
          I was involved with building the majority of the front end, making use of Vue 3 to build a [chair configurator](https://www.hslchairs.com/chairs/riser-recliners/aysgarth-riser-recliner#cylindoCta) for product pages (pictured) and a UI to guide users to chair recomendations based on their needs. Imagery is generated by a 3rd party, who also provide access to an API, allowing you to request images for specific products with specific specifications.

          Much of the styling was built with a utility first mindset, to keep stylesheets small in filesize, and to provide easy to understand styles to all other developers.

      company: Miller Homes Customer Journey
      text: > 
            Miller Homes wanted to take potential customers through their buying process, in a way that was fun and engaging.

              This animated landing page is built using React and GreenSock, hooking into the user's scroll position to animate keys along paths. The page also makes use of the IntersectionObserver API to trigger embedded MP4s to play.

      company: Persimmon Homes
      text: >
            A big project for us during the pandemic. We were tasked with completing a project that had previously been in development at another agency.
              There were extremely tight deadlines for this project, so as much of the existing front end code had to remain. 
              The site is based on Bootstrap, and makes some use of Preact for the search functionality (previously React, but was switched to reduce the size of compiled bundles).

      company: Baby Blocker
      text: >
            One of the first projects I worked on at McCann. We built a browser extension that blocked baby photos in Facebook feeds, comparing each post with a set of keywords. The project was built during the pregnancy of a member of the royal family, and Skyn Condoms wanted to use that to promote their brand in a unique way.

              The extension unfortunately is no longer available, but you can view a small clip about the project at the link below!

      company: Wedding RSVP
      text: >
            Why spend money on printed wedding invites and chasing people up to send their RSVP when VueJS and Netlify exist?

              This was a quick project thrown together in a few evenings to distribute information, and allow our wedding guests to respond with their menu choices along with any allergy preferences.

              The app is compromised of a handful of Vue components, and makes use of Netlify Forms for data collection.
