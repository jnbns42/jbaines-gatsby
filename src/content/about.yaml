intro: I've been working as a developer for nearly 10 years. I've worked on a variety of projects over the years, everything from large e-commerce projects to Google Chrome extensions.

            I currently work as the Senior Front End Dev on my team. I'm not sure how much I can divulge here in terms of the 
            clients I have completed work for sadly! Since I joined, I have been working towards modernising the front end tech we use on Umbraco projects,
            moving away from jQuery and towards ES6 and other JS frameworks.    

              I'm a big advocate of the [Frameworkless Movement](https://www.frameworklessmovement.org/). Some of the projects I have worked on have been
            purely ES6 Javascript, though I have worked on projects that require React (well...[Preact](https://preactjs.com/) technically) to produce
            reusable components.    

              I also had the pleasure of contributing to [this little project](https://winners.webbyawards.com/2020/social/features/experimental-innovation/122408/baby-blocker), which won a Webby!

            I was brought on to help the company bring in some of the development work in house. I worked largely with
            AngularJS, Vue.js, SASS (using the BEM methodology) and Gulp, to produce flexible, reusable front end code for C# based websites.

            More of a full stack role than front end. During my time at ADZ I worked on Wordpress and Laravel projects, ranging from eCommerce builds
            to more content driven websites.

            Where I started! I joined as a graduate in 2011, initially building HTML emails (and occasionally designing them) as part of Venditans email marketting offering.
            I eventually worked my way up to a mid level role, and was moved to the Front End Team. Despite it's name, the team actually worked
            very heavily with PHP to hook sites into their eCommerce platform.
